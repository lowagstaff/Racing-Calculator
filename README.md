# Racing-Calculator
Python and C calculator to decide which vehicle "wins" a race 

There are 2 Python files, one is the main code and the other is a testing code. 
This code takes vehicle information from the Vehicles.CSV file and uses that information to compare 2 vehicles and decides who the winner is. 
With the use of if/elif/else functions, which is the brains of the code, it decides the winner between 2 vehicles, depending on the race.
The 2 vehicles and type of race is chosen by user inputs. 

I made a similair program with C.
This program uses pointers and raw user input to get the vehicle information.
The rest of the code is similair in how it works.
